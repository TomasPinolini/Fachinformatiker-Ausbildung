#7 Student Grade Management System.

# CSV File Management: Using Pythonâ€™s csv module to store, retrieve, update, and delete student records persistently.
# Data Input and Validation: Ensuring user input is correctly formatted, preventing empty or incorrect data entries.
# CRUD Operations: Implementing the four core operations:
# Create: Add new student records.
# Read: View all student records.
# Update: Modify a student's grade.
# Delete: Remove a student record.
# Error Handling: Managing file-related exceptions and handling cases where records are missing.
# User Interface: A simple, menu-driven text-based interface that allows users to interact with the system.
# Persistence: Ensuring student data remains saved between program runs by storing it in a CSV file.
# Scalability & Maintainability: Writing modular and readable code that can be expanded to include more features like searching or grade statistics.

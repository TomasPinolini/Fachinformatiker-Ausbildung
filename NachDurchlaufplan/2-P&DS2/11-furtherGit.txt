1) Collaborate with Branches
    Objective: Use branching to manage changes.
    - Create a new branch:
        . git branch feature-branch
        . git switch feature-branch
    - Modify hello.txt (e.g., add a line This is a feature branch.).
    - Add and commit the changes:
        . git add hello.txt
        . git commit -m "Add a feature branch message"
    - Switch back to the main branch and merge the changes:
    . git switch main
    . git merge feature-branch
    . git push origin main
    - Checking Task: Check GitHub to confirm the merged changes.


2) Collaborate with Branches
    - Objective: Use branching to manage changes.
    - Create a new branch:
        . git branch feature-branch
        . git switch feature-branch
    - Modify hello.txt (e.g., add a line This is a feature branch.).
    - Add and commit the changes:
        . git add hello.txt
        . git commit -m "Add a feature branch message"
    - Switch back to the main branch and merge the changes:
        . git switch main
        . git merge feature-branch
        . git push origin main
    - Checking Task: Check GitHub to confirm the merged changes.


3) View and Undo Staged Changes
    Objective: Learn how to view and unstage changes.
    - Modify hello.txt by adding a new line (e.g., Adding temporary changes).
    - Stage the file:
        . git add hello.txt
    - View staged changes:
        . git diff --cached
    - Unstage the file:
        . git restore --staged hello.txt
    - Task: Verify that the file is no longer staged:
        . git status


4) Resolve Merge Conflicts
    Objective: Handle conflicts that arise during a merge.
    - Create and switch to a new branch:
        . git branch conflict-branch
        . git switch conflict-branch
    - Modify hello.txt by adding a conflicting line (e.g., This is from conflict-branch.).
    - Add and commit the changes:
        . git add hello.txt
        . git commit -m "Add conflict line in conflict-branch"
    - Switch back to the main branch and make a conflicting edit to the same line.
    - Add and commit the changes:
        . git add hello.txt
        . git commit -m "Add conflict line in main branch"
    - Attempt to merge conflict-branch into main:
        . git merge conflict-branch
    - Task: Use a text editor or Git tools to resolve the conflict.
        . git add hello.txt
        . git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
